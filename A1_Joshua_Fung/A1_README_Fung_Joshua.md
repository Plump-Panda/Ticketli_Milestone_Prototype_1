# Technologies Used
This web application was built using react.


# Work Done
The purpose of this semi-functional is to show the milestone dashboard home page that was designed in my wireframe. There isn't any functionality for this prototype because it aims to show the general format, location for where it data should be displayed, and a general idea of what type of data will be shown to the user. The milestone dashboard contains a title, completion rate, edit button, ticket board button, ticket details, general details, and details about who is involved with the milestone. Four components were made for this prototype (MainStats, Navbar, People, Ticket).
